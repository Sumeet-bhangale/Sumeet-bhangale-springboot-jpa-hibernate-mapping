ðŸš€ Mastering Spring Data JPA: Implementing @OneToOne Mapping with User and AadharCard Entities ðŸš€
ðŸ“š A Step-by-Step Guide to Efficiently Managing Entity Relationships in Spring Boot Applications ðŸ“š

Overview
In this guide, we'll walk through how to establish a @OneToOne relationship between User and AadharCard entities. This mapping type is perfect for scenarios where one entity is closely associated with another, such as a user having a unique identification card. By the end of this tutorial, you'll clearly understand how to implement and utilize @OneToOne mappings in your Spring Boot applications.

JPA One-to-One Mapping
In JPA (Java Persistence API), a one-to-one mapping is used to define a relationship between two entities where each instance of one entity is associated with exactly one instance of the other entity. This is typically represented in the database schema with a foreign key in one table that references the primary key of another table. There are two types of one-to-one mappings: Unidirectional and Bidirectional.

Unidirectional One-to-One Mapping
In unidirectional one-to-one mapping, only one entity knows about the relationship. For example, in our User and AadharCard scenario, if the User knows about AadharCard but AadharCard does not have a reference to the User, it is unidirectional mapping.

Bidirectional One-to-One Mapping
In bidirectional one-to-one mapping, both entities are aware of the relationship. Continuing with our example, if the User has a reference to AadharCard and AadharCard also has a reference to the User, it is bidirectional mapping.

You need to add a@OneToOneannotation in theAadharCardentity to reference theUserentity. Additionally, you need to update theUserthe entity to properly link to theAadharCardentity.

Conclusion:
In our setup, we've implemented both unidirectional and bidirectional one-to-one mappings between the User and AadharCard entities.

These mappings provide us with flexibility in managing the relationship between users and AadharCards. The unidirectional mapping simplifies the database structure by storing the AadharCard ID in the User table, while the bidirectional mapping allows for easy navigation between User and AadharCard entities, enhancing the readability and maintainability of our code.
